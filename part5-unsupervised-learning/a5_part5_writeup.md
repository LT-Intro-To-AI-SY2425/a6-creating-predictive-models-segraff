# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.

 I would classify the red group as "Frugal" as they spend the least amount and have the least annual income. However, the blue group would be "Shopping Addicts" because they have the greatest income and spending. The orange group would be classified as moderate spenders because they have around the median for annual income and spending. I would classify the purple group as impulsive buyers as they spend as much as the shopaholics even though they have a low annual income and the green group as "careful spenders" since they have a high annual income but do not spend much.


2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?

A customer who has a medium income and a low spending habits would be in the moderate spenders group. 
 


3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group? 

One cluster of interest to me is the frugal group because that is the one I most fall into. The marketing team could get target this group by having a BOGO sale or a discount to encourage these frugal spenders to purchase something.
