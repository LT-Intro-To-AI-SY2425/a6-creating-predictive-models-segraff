# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?

The r squared value is 0.79. This means that 79% of the variation in blood pressure is explained by age, suggesting that age is a strong predictor of blood pressure in the linear regression model. 

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?

The predicted systolic blood pressure for a person 42 years old is around 137.5.

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

0.79 is a fairly strong correlation but it's not accurate enough to predict someone's blood pressure based on age because blood pressure is very specific to an individual. There are also other factors that could determine blood pressure like weight and stress. If the data set included more data and included more trials it would be a more useful model at predicting blood pressures by age.
