# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?

This model is more effective than the model I created in the previous lesson because it allows us to see the training data, testing data, and the predictions. Training the data is also beneficial for seeing how accurate the model is. 

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?

The R squared coefficient tells me that 62.6% of the variation in blood pressure can be explained by the linear relationship with age. 

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.

Based on the provided data, I think that my model performed accurately in the tree trials. However, I would not consider it reliable for real-world use. The predictions for the younger ages of 17 and 20 had a minimal margin of error, but the error was significantly larger for the 56-year-old prediction. I believe that with more data to train the model, I would have a better understanding of its actual accuracy.
