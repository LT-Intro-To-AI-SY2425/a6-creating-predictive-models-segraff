# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?

The r-squared value for this model was 0.86. This means that the model predicts about 86% of the data correctly.

2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?

This model was by far the most accurate as it had the highest r squared coefficient and r value. 

3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?

The predicted price for a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is $10,601.26. The predicted price for a 20-year-old car with 150,000 miles is $2,802.54.

4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?

This may be occurring because a majority of the data was with lower ages and mileages so the model is not yet able to comprehend multiple different ages and mileages.
